# Decentralized Music Sharing Platform

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Music Sharing Platform** allows artists to share and monetize their music as NFTs or digital assets. The platform leverages smart contracts to handle the distribution, royalties, and payments using Lumens (XLM). By utilizing blockchain technology, the platform provides transparency, security, and fairness in music distribution and monetization, empowering artists to have control over their work.

## Project Vision
The **Decentralized Music Sharing Platform** aims to create an artist-first ecosystem where creators can directly connect with their audience and receive fair compensation for their work. By decentralizing music distribution, artists no longer rely on intermediaries, ensuring that they retain ownership and revenue from their content. The platform strives to promote innovation in the music industry by using blockchain to make music sharing, licensing, and payments seamless.
